# Lane-Select
League of Legends script/macro designed to filter out champions based on their respective lane.

Hello. Welcome to my simple, but effective, program. Feel free to modify in any way you please!

This program runs using AutoHotKey. https://autohotkey.com/ 
It is a simple and free program that allows user to creat simple text scripts.

Now even though this is a "Script" it is not a bannable offense. (I'm like 98% sure)
It provides no advantage for gameplay at all, it is merely a champ select filtering tool.

There are very few controls you need to know/understand to use this program effectively.
The program comes pre-programmed to use the F1-F5 Keys, you can change them easily if you'd like.
Each key is bound to a certain role. ex. Top, Jungle etc.

I left out an ADC script due to the fact that there is already a "Marskman" tab in the client.
However, to make up for this I created a script that filters out your preferred champions. 
(Example of why you would want to edit the program)

Understanding this program is relatively simple. All you have to do is replace a few lines of code :)
